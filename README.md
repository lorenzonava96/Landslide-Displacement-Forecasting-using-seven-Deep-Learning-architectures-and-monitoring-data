# Landslide Displacement Forecasting using Deep Learning and monitoring data

This repository contains the code implementation for the research paper titled "Landslide Displacement Forecasting using Deep Learning and Monitoring Data across Selected Sites" by Nava et al. The paper will be published soon in the Landslides Journal.

The code in this repository allows you to fine-tune seven different deep learning models for landslide displacement forecasting. Please note that we are unable to share the original data used in the research. However, we have provided fake data in the data folder, which has a similar format and structure to the original data.

You are encouraged to use this code with your own data. If you have any questions or require assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me.
